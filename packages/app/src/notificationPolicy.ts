/**
 * When a finished turn is worth a notification, and what it should say.
 *
 * pew2's whole premise is that the agent keeps working while the phone is in a
 * pocket or on another conversation. A banner is therefore not decoration: it
 * is the only way to learn that a five-minute turn in another project has
 * landed. This module decides that, and nothing else — no Expo imports, so the
 * rule is testable under `bun test`, which cannot parse React Native's Flow
 * syntax. `ui/notifier.ts` binds the SDK. Same split as
 * `hapticsPolicy.ts`/`ui/haptics.ts`.

/**
 * The banner for a turn that just ended, or null when it is not worth showing.
 *
 * Two cases are left alone, for opposite reasons:
 *
 * - **Already looking at that conversation.** The reply is on screen and a
 *   banner over it is noise.
 * - **Backgrounded, with a push on its way.** Both routes would fire and the
 *   user would get the same turn twice. This is not hypothetical: on Android
 *   the socket outlives the app leaving the screen, so `session.idle` still
 *   arrives — and `setNotificationHandler`, which drops a redundant push, only
 *   runs while the app is in the foreground. Nothing on the device can dedupe
 *   the pair at that point, so the decision has to be made here, before the
 *   local banner is scheduled at all.
 *
 *   Deliberately yields to the push rather than the reverse: it is the only one
 *   of the two that also works once iOS has suspended this app, so preferring
 *   it keeps one code path warm instead of two that differ per platform. The
 *   cost is that a push lost to a network failure is not backfilled locally.
 *
 * Everything else — foreground on another session, or backgrounded with no push
 * token at all — gets the local banner, which is exactly what it is for.

 * The daemon pushes on every finished turn without knowing what this phone is

 * other source of that answer is the relay, which is assumed hostile. So the
 * push is sent optimistically and judged here, where the facts actually are.
 *
 * Two things make a push redundant:
 *
 * 1. The conversation is open on screen. The reply is already visible; a banner
 *    over it is noise. Same rule `finishedNotice` applies to the local route.
 * 2. This app already raised a banner for that turn moments ago. Both routes
 *    fire when the app is awake and backgrounded — common on Android, where the
 *    socket survives longer — and without this the user gets each turn twice.
 *
 * Local banners are never suppressed: `finishedNotice` has already ruled on
 * them, and applying a second rule here would only find new ways to be wrong.
