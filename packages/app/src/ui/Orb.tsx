/**
 * The agent mark.
 *
 * One sphere is the app's memorable device: it stands in for "an agent is
 * here", takes the provider's own colour so Claude, Codex and Gemini are
 * distinguishable at a glance, and is the only saturated thing on an otherwise
 * monochrome canvas.
 *
 * It is drawn as a dot-matrix panel because the wordmark beside it is set in
 * Bitcount, a single-module dot-matrix face — the logotype is already an LED
 * grid, so the mark is built from the same cells rather than being a gradient
 * disc with nothing in common with the type. It also says what the product is:
 * a readout of a machine you are not sitting at.
 *
 * Shading is dot area and opacity, never a gradient, because that is the only
 * way a real matrix panel can render a tone. `orbMatrix.ts` owns that geometry.
