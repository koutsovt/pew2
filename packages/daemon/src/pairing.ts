/**
 * Pairing: how a phone learns where the daemon is, and proves it may connect.
 *
 * A pairing is one 32-byte **root key**, and everything else derives from it:
 *
 *   - the **room id** the relay routes on, via a one-way HKDF. The relay is
 *     given this and cannot work backwards to the key, so it can order traffic
 *     without being able to read it. It doubles as the LAN connection token,
 *     where there is no relay in between.
 *   - the two **message keys**, one per direction, which never leave the two
 *     endpoints.
 *
 * The root key reaches the phone in the QR's URL *fragment*, which is never
 * transmitted to a server — so the relay never sees it, even at pairing time.
 *
 * Generated with real entropy, stored 0600, and printed nowhere but the QR.
