/**
 * The layout of `pew2 pair`, as pure functions.
 *
 * Rendering is separated from doing so the screen can be tested without a
 * daemon, a relay, a phone or a terminal. Every function here takes plain data
 * and returns lines of text; nothing reads the environment, opens a socket or
 * writes to stdout.
 *
 * The screen answers three questions, in the order a user asks them:
 *
 *   1. What do I do?          the QR, and two numbered steps
 *   2. Will it work?          reach, daemon, relay — checked, not claimed
 *   3. Did it work?           a live line that resolves when the phone connects
 *
 * Facts are never asserted without having been verified. "Works from anywhere"
 * printed next to an unreachable relay is worse than no status line, because it
 * sends the user to debug their phone instead of their relay.
