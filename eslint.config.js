/**
 * What the linter is for here.
 *
 * TypeScript already checks types and the tests already check behaviour, so a
 * linter that also argues about quote marks and line length is pure noise — and
 * a noisy linter gets `--no-verify`'d within a week. So this config carries
 * almost no style rules. What it does carry are the rules that need the type
 * checker to work at all, because those catch a class of bug nothing else here
 * can see:
 *
 *   - a promise nobody awaited, in a daemon that is mostly sockets and spawned
 *     processes, where the symptom is an operation that silently never happens
 *   - an async function handed to something expecting a sync callback, where
 *     the rejection goes nowhere
 *   - an `await` on a value that was never a promise
 *   - a switch that stopped being exhaustive when someone added a variant
 *
 * A lot is switched off below, and every one of those says why. That matters
 * more than the list of what is on: a rule disabled without a reason is how a
 * config stops being trustworthy.
 *
 * Formatting is deliberately not linted. If that ever matters, it is a
 * formatter's job, not this file's.
