# Changelog

What changed, in the words of someone running it rather than someone writing it.

One version number ships: the `pew2` binary, tagged in this repository and
published in [Releases](https://github.com/KenKaiii/pew2/releases). The phone app
carries its own store version, which store rules forbid moving backwards. The
`protocol` and `relay` packages are internal and now carry none at all — nothing
installs them separately, and what an app and a daemon must agree on is
`WIRE_VERSION`, which is checked on every connection.

Dates are the day the tag was cut.

## 0.9.14 — 2026-08-08

### Fixed

- **The model pill always names the model that will answer.** Reopening an old
  conversation and then starting a new one showed the old one's model, while the
  prompt actually ran on the one you last chose — and the pill only corrected
  itself after you had sent something. A new conversation opens with your
  remembered choice; a reopened one comes back with whatever it was last used
  with. Those are two different answers, and the pill was showing whichever had
  arrived most recently.

  It now shows nothing at all for the moment while a conversation is still
  loading, rather than guessing. Changing a model in one conversation also
  updates what the next one will open with, on every device you have paired.

- Cold launch, streaming and idle battery cost are all down. Long replies
  re-parsed the entire message on every chunk that arrived, blurred surfaces were
  rebuilt rather than reused, and animations kept running while the app was in
  the background.
- The model dropdown could open transparent on its first use, and looked right
  the next time. Fading a blurred surface is what did it; the card is scaled now
  and never faded.
- A notification banner is shown even when the computer could not register for
  remote push — the local one was being suppressed by the failure of the remote
  one, so a refused token meant no notification at all rather than the one that
  still worked.
- "Can't reach your computer" clears itself when the app comes back and the
  connection succeeds, instead of staying on screen over a working session.

### Added

- **Finished turns notify you while the app is closed.** Until now a reply that
  landed while you were in another app was silent until you opened it again.

## 0.9.13 — 2026-08-08

### Fixed

- **`pew2 pair` can always pair again.** A pairing admits one device, so once a
  phone had claimed it the printed code could not onboard anyone: the phone
  holding it never needs to scan again, and everyone else is refused — including
  that same phone after reinstalling the app, which clears its identity. The
  command now mints a fresh code in that situation rather than printing one
  nothing can use, and names the phone it just unpaired.

  A code nobody has claimed is still printed unchanged, so running the command
  twice while walking to your phone does not invalidate the QR you are halfway
  through scanning. `--rotate` remains for the case this cannot see: a code that
  leaked before it was ever used looks untouched, and still has to be replaced.

  This closes a loop. The app's own refusal tells you to run `pew2 pair` on the
  machine, which until now handed back the same code that had just been refused.

## 0.9.12 — 2026-08-08

### Security

- **A pairing link now admits one device.** The link never expires, which is what
  lets a phone reconnect after a reboot without scanning anything — but it also
  meant a code caught on camera stayed usable forever. The first device to
  complete a handshake claims the pairing; every later one is refused. Your phone
  keeps reconnecting as before, and a QR that appears in a screenshot or a video
  is worthless once it has.

  Rotation is still the only revocation, and it is still all-or-nothing: run
  `pew2 pair --rotate` to move a pairing to a different phone. A link that leaked
  *before* it was ever used must be rotated, not merely re-scanned — whoever
  claims it first, wins.

- **Every phone used to call itself `phone`.** `pew2 pair` prints a link
  containing `deviceId=phone` so the URL is valid on its own, and the app kept
  that name instead of using its own. Devices were indistinguishable, which would
  have made the claim above decorative. The app now always substitutes its own
  identifier, drawn from the system's secure random source rather than
  `Math.random`.

- **A refusal is addressed to the device it refuses.** The relay forwards
  cleartext to every app in a room, so an unaddressed refusal reached the phone
  that owned the pairing too — and it treats one as final. Left alone, that handed
  anyone holding a leaked link a single frame that would knock the real device
  offline.

### Fixed

- **A dead pairing code says so instead of hanging.** Scanning a rotated or
  retired code checked only that the link was well-formed, then moved on to the
  main screen and sat on "Connecting to your machine..." indefinitely — the one
  state that looks like a slow network and is actually permanent. Both refusals
  happen below the socket and send nothing back, so the app now completes a real
  handshake before it accepts a code, and stays put with the reason if it fails.
- **A machine that cannot be reached stops claiming it is nearly there.** After
  about fifteen seconds the app says so plainly and names what to check, while
  continuing to retry in the background — a sleeping laptop and a retired token
  are indistinguishable from the phone, and one of them comes back on its own.
- **`pew2 pair` warns before you scan** when a pairing already belongs to a
  device, rather than leaving you to discover it as a refusal on the phone.

### Upgrading

Nothing to do. A phone paired before this release keeps working, and claims the
pairing properly the first time it connects from an updated app.

## 0.9.11 — 2026-08-07

### Security

- **A sealed frame is only accepted from a device that proved it holds the key.**
  The sender label on a relayed frame is chosen by whoever opened the socket, and
  it decided which replay window a frame was checked against — so a captured
  frame replayed under a new name was accepted, including a `session.permission`
  that re-approved a tool call you had approved once.
- **A `hello` no longer clears a device's replay protection before its proof is
  checked**, and a proof is accepted once: replaying one captured inside its
  two-minute window is refused.
- **A `cwd` from a client is honoured only for a project this daemon itself
  offered.** `session.start`, `session.resume` and `provider.sessions` took the
  path at face value, so a message could start an agent anywhere on disk — and
  make the whole filesystem readable through `image.fetch`, which trusts that
  same directory as its root. Starting and listing now refuse an unrecognised
  path outright; resuming falls back to the agent's own last project instead,
  because it is sent during reconnect before the daemon has finished working out
  which projects it knows.
- **A daemon that is still answering keepalives keeps its place in a relay room.**
  Eviction was by arrival, and the room id is not the key, so anyone who learned
  one could keep the real machine permanently offline. The cost is that a laptop
  which changes network may take up to 90 seconds to reclaim its room, rather
  than the second it used to, since the socket it left behind has to look dead
  first.
- **`PEW2_TOKEN` is refused below 32 characters.** It is a single hash away from
  being the encryption key, with no salt and no stretching, so a short one can be
  brute-forced offline against a room id the relay already knows.
- **Attachments and cached transcripts are written owner-only.** They landed at
  0644 in a shared temp directory, at a predictable path, and `image.fetch`
  allows that directory as a root.
- **An image is opened once and read from that descriptor.** Resolving, checking,
  then re-opening by name let a file be swapped for a symlink in between.
- **The installer refuses a download whose checksum is missing.** The check was
  skipped when the `.sha256` was absent, so whoever served the binary could turn
  it off by serving one file less.
- **GitHub Actions are pinned to commit SHAs.** A tag can be moved to different
  code by whoever owns the action.

### Fixed

- Preferences are written atomically: a crash mid-write left a truncated file,
  which reads as "nothing was ever chosen" for every provider at once.
- The relay no longer wakes from hibernation to answer a keepalive, and sweeps
  sockets whose far end vanished without closing — sixteen of those and a room
  turns away the machines that belong in it.
- The relay's event log is gone. Nothing read it back (the app discards any frame
  that is not a sealed envelope, and the relay has no key to seal one with),
  while anyone holding a room id could fill it.
- Inbound messages are validated against the published wire schemas at one place,
  instead of each case re-checking a hand-written shape.
- The app caps a conversation's turns in memory, matching the daemon's transcript
  cache. It was the only unbounded store in the system, on the device with the
  least memory in it.
- Sheets open the moment you tap, instead of a beat later. Every one of them
  waited to be measured before it would move, which cost three passes over the
  whole screen before the first frame; the new chat sheet also stuttered on its
  way to the project list, because resizing the card was making the screen
  redraw on every frame of its own animation. The menu is the same story: it was
  dragged from the same place the conversation arrives, so it stalled while an
  agent was replying, which is exactly when you reach for it.

### Added

- Sheets and the menu can be thrown. Drag a sheet down by its top edge to send
  it away, or the menu across from either side; let go part way and it goes back
  where it came from, at the speed you let go at.
- Crash reporting, on-device only: a fatal error outside a render — the kind that
  ends the process with no error boundary to catch it — is recorded on the way
  down and shown on the next launch, with nothing sent anywhere.

Two of these are groundwork rather than working features, and are listed so the
next person does not assume otherwise:

- `expo-updates` is installed and pinned to the app version, which is what a
  future update must not cross. It cannot deliver anything yet: that needs an
  `updates.url` from an EAS project this repository does not have.
- The `pew2://` URL scheme is registered, which a build has to do before any link
  can reach the app. Nothing routes an incoming link yet — pairing is still
  camera-only — and a link that paired on arrival would let any app that can open
  a URL point your phone at someone else's daemon, so that handler needs a
  confirmation step designed first.

## 0.9.10 — 2026-08-07

- Idle agents are given back after fifteen minutes rather than an hour.

## 0.9.9 — 2026-08-07

- A reconnecting phone no longer asks an agent to resend a conversation already
  on screen.

## 0.9.8 — 2026-08-07

- Capped how many conversations may hold an agent process at once.

## 0.9.7 — 2026-08-07

- Idle agent processes are given back instead of held for the life of the daemon.

## 0.9.6 — 2026-08-06

- The agent count the phone is promised no longer includes test fixtures.
- The dock knows both its heights in advance, so opening the composer no longer
  reflows the thread.
